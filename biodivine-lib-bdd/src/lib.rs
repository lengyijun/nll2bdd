//! This crate provides a basic implementation of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) â€” a symbolic data
//! structure for representing boolean functions or other equivalent objects (such as bit-vector
//! sets).
//!
//! Compared to other popular implementations, every BDD owns its memory. It is thus trivial to
//! serialise, but also to share between threads. This makes it useful for applications that
//! process high number of BDDs concurrently.
//!
//! We currently provide support for explicit operations as well as evaluation of basic boolean
//! expressions and a custom `bdd` macro for hybrid usage:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use biodivine_lib_bdd::*;
//!
//! let vars = BddVariableSet::new(vec!["a", "b", "c"]);
//! let a = vars.mk_var_by_name("a");
//! let b = vars.mk_var_by_name("b");
//! let c = vars.mk_var_by_name("c");
//!
//! let f1 = a.iff(&b.not()).or(&c.xor(&a));
//! let f2 = vars.eval_expression_string("(a <=> !b) | c ^ a");
//! let f3 = bdd!((a <=> (!b)) | (c ^ a));
//!
//! assert!(!f1.is_false());
//! assert_eq!(f1.cardinality(), 6.0);
//! assert_eq!(f1, f2);
//! assert_eq!(f2, f3);
//! assert!(f1.iff(&f2).is_true());
//! assert!(f1.iff(&f3).is_true());
//! ```
//!
//! Additionally, we provide serialisation into a custom string and binary formats as well as `.dot`.
//! For a more detailed description, see the [tutorial module](./tutorial/index.html) documentation.
//! There is also an experimental support for converting BDDs back into boolean expressions.
